General: 
Career decisions are lengthy and complicated for both prospective and seasoned professionals. Canadian Industry Watchlens aims to help by displaying data on industry changes in a visual way, highlighting the trends in number of jobs in an industry over time. The app also highlights the trends in industry per province. 

The app took data from the Income dataset to display charts and maps showing the amount of employment in an industry (agriculture, manufacturing, etc). The program can display chart comparisons between different industries for a specific province or country wide. A map function will show the amount of growth as a color gradient across the country according to the percentage in change in an industry for a range of years. 

Technical details: 
The application has been created using php, jquery, mysql and html. It has been uploaded to Amazon's EC2 server. It is also available as an Android application.    

Dataset:
